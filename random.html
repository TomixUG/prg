          <p><b>What Is a URL Shortener?</b></p>
          <p>
            A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple
            tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your
            marketing efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter,
            more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened version,
            they’re automatically forwarded to the destination URL.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname
            for your long webpage address. You can, for example, use a short URL
            like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about
            where your link will lead before they click it.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL
            shortener.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener
            above.

        <div class="single-faq">
          <p><b>Benefits of a Short URL</b></p>
          <p>
            How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if
            it has tons of characters and symbols? A short URL can make your
            link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily recall
            and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve
            traffic to your content.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate
            into your collateral – whether you’re looking to engage with your
            customers offline or online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitly is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to
            small brands to large enterprises, who are looking for a simple way
            to create, track and manage their links.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="single-faq">
          <p><b>What is a Custom URL Shortener?</b></p>
          <p>
            A custom URL shortener, sometimes referred to as a branded URL
            shortener, lets you brand your links.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, instead of bit.ly/xyz, you could use a custom short URL
            like yourbrnd.co/xyz.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are several benefits of branding your short links. Branded
            links build trust between your audience and your business, drive
            more clicks, give your audience a preview of where they are being
            taken and increase brand awareness.
          </p>

          <p>
            A link shortening service that includes custom short URLs is vital
            to improving audience engagement with your communications. A short
            URL is good, but a custom URL works every time.
